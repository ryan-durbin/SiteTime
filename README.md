Server/Website Uptime Monitoring
================================

I will upload this when I get a chance, but this will be where I store my files for you all to see concerning a project I've moved past.

Last year I decided to start writing all the code from scratch to build a server uptime pinging service.

This project was never finished. Between working full time, going back to school and being married I maybe was able to put in 30 hours over the last 2 years. That being said don't expect any amazing code :)

I will create an instalation guide soon when the time comes, just to keep with the whole "clean" feeling I've found here on github.

The backend is complete and I've had it running for many months without a hickup, but the front end and payments aren't functional.

Instalation
